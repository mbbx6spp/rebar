Indenting
~~~~~~~~~
To have consistent indenting we have vi modeline/emacs local variable
headers in rebar's source files. This works automatically with vi.
With Emacs you have to declare 'erlang-indent-level set to 4'
as a safe local variable value. If not configured Emacs will prompt
you to save this as part of custom-set-variables:
 '(safe-local-variable-values (quote ((erlang-indent-level . 4))))
You can also tell Emacs to ignore file variables:
(setq enable-local-variables nil
      enable-local-eval nil)
